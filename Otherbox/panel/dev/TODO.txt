* fully-automatic margins based on what was actually rendered, with respect to "off this edge" alignment

MY ANSWER: erm... yeah, would need a bit of thought, though. half the point is that the nice fixed margins give us a nice regular layout; if we allowed automatic margins it would step outside that model. might provide it as an option, but what would need to be automatically accounted for? titles? x/ylabels? tick labels? needs some thought.

* offer intuitive interface to margins on individual panels (e.g. offer 'p.marginbottom' etc.)

MY ANSWER: this sounds straightforward, let's do that.

* turn on rendering of box-model, so it's easy to see where the margins come from.

MY ANSWER: thought about this; not as easy as it sounds. had a look at the way Matlab adds lines to figures, and it looks like it does an axis-in-the-background trick. i may look into this at some point, but i'll not lose any sleep about it.

* Implement using a HANDLE class inheritance

MY ANSWER: implement using a HANDLE class: yeah, well this was written back in the dark days when such things weren't possible. i do fancy reimplementing at some point, would be slicker. if i ever get the time :)

IMPORTANT: if we do this, take the opportunity to change a couple of things...
	1) "parentmargin" and "axismargin" should be (inherited) defaults, but the individual margin of each panel should just be in "margin" - setting this to [] would return it to use the local default (usually, inherited from the default panel above the root panel)
	2) give easy access to children, through p.getChildren() or p.getChild(). also have it so if you display "p", you see the tree of its children.

* Allow margins to be set individually so that defaults remain 
e.g. axismargin(10,[],[].10);

MY ANSWER: re the defaults idea, yeah i see what you mean. i'll stick it on the todo list.

Very useful tool.

It would be nice to be able to easily add a panel-wide xlabel/ylabel spanning multiple children.

Hi Niko - thanks. You mean, I think, so that the xlabel/ylabel were positioned as if the four (say) sub-panels were all one axis. That's a good idea, yeah. I guess another possibility is that you might want to set all the xlabels/ylabels of all the sub-panels through a single command. Both things are possible, but the first sounds particularly useful. I'll look into it.

Thanks for the feedback.
