SALPA is a Matlab function to filter artifacts from neural recordings.
See Wagenaar DA, Potter SM, 2002 J Neurosci Methods 120(2):113-20)
for more details on the algorithm.

INSTALLATION
1) Move SALPA.m and SALPAmex4.c to your working directory (or any directory
within your path).

2) Compile SALPAmex4.c to your platform by typing "mex SALPAmex4.c" at 
the Matlab command prompt.

KNOWN ISSUES
I have only tested this software on Windows (XP, Vista 32-bit, and Vista 64-bit).
I'm not sure if some of the C code will have to be rewritten for 
Linux or Mac.

Please report any bugs or issues!

Sincerely,
John Rolston
