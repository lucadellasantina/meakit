 [N E] = rentian_scaling(A,XYZ,n)

 Physical Rentian scaling (or more simply Rentian scaling) is a property 
 of systems that are cost-efficiently embedded into physical space. It is 
 what is called a &quot;topo-physical&quot; property because it combines information 
 regarding the topological organization of the graph with information 
 about the physical placement of connections. Rentian scaling is present 
 in very large scale integrated circuits, the C. elegans neuronal network, 
 and morphometric and diffusion-based graphs of human anatomical networks.
 Rentian scaling is determined by partitioning the system into cubes, 
 counting the number of nodes inside of each cube (N), and the number of 
 edges traversing the boundary of each cube (E). If the system displays 
 Rentian scaling, these two variables N and E will scale with one another 
 in loglog space. The Rent's exponent is given by the slope of log10(E) 
 vs. log10(N), and can be reported alone or can be compared to the 
 theoretical minimum Rent's exponent to determine how cost efficiently the 
 network has been embedded into physical space. Note: if a system displays 
 Rentian scaling, it does not automatically mean that the system is 
 cost-efficiently embedded (although it does suggest that). Validation 
 occurs when comparing to the theoretical minimum Rent's exponent for that
 system.

 Inputs:
     A is the MxM adjacency matrix which must be unweighted, binary, and symmetric.
     XYZ is the vector of node placement coordinates - must be Mx3 matrix.
        where M is the number of nodes.
     n is a scalar - the number of partitions to compute
        Each partition is a data point.
       You want a large enough number to adequately estimate the Rent's exponent.

 Outputs:
    N is an nx1 vector of the number of nodes in each of the n partitions
    E is an nx1 vector of the number of edges crossing the boundary of each partition

 Subsequent Analysis:
     Rentian scaling plots are then created by: figure; loglog(E,N,'*');
    To determine the Rent's exponent, p, it is important not to use partitions which may 
        be affected by boundary conditions. In Bassett et al. 2010 PLoS CB, only 
        partitions with N&lt;M/2 were used in the estimation of the Rent's exponent. 
        Thus, we can define N_prime = N(find(N&lt;M/2)) and E_prime = E(find(N&lt;M/2)). Next we 
        need to determine the slope of Eprime vs. Nprime in loglog space, which is the Rent's 
        exponent. There are many ways of doing this with more or less statistical 
        rigor. Robustfit in MATLAB is one such option:
       [b,stats] = robustfit(log10(N_prime),log10(E_prime))
       Then the Rent's exponent is b(1,2) and the standard error of the
       estimation is given by stats.se(1,2).

 Note: n=5000 was used in Bassett et al. 2010 in PLoS CB.
